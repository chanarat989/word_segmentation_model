# word_segmentation_model
Performance test with 2 model construction
Model Construction – option1 - > LSTM
Model Construction – option2 - > LSTM, Conv1D, Bidirectional

Result
Model Construction – option1 = > accuracy 0.9566, lost=0.1140
Model Construction – option2 = > accuracy 0.9614, lost=0.1020

Conclusion Model Construction – option2 is better performance
